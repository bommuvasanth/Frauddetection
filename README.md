## 🛡️ Fraud Detection System – Real-Time AI-Based Solution

### 🚀 Overview

This project is an intelligent, real-time **Fraud Detection System** designed to protect e-commerce platforms and financial institutions from fraudulent transactions using AI, risk scoring, and automated decision-making.

> 🔍 "Think of it as a smart security guard that works 24/7, instantly blocking suspicious transactions and alerting analysts."

---

### 🎯 Key Features

* ⚡ Real-time fraud detection in under 0.1 seconds
* 🧠 AI-powered risk scoring (0–100%)
* 📊 Streamlit dashboard for monitoring transactions
* 📩 Email alerts for high-risk transactions
* 🧾 MongoDB-based persistent storage
* 📈 Self-learning capability from feedback

---

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   Captures details like email, amount, account age, time of transaction, etc.

2. **Intelligent Analysis**
   Machine learning model checks for:

   * Suspicious emails
   * Unusual transaction amounts or times
   * New accounts making expensive purchases

3. **Risk Scoring**

   * 0–30% → ✅ Approve
   * 30–70% → ⚠️ Review
   * 70–100% → ⛔ Block

4. **Instant Decision**
   Backend responds within milliseconds and logs data into MongoDB.

5. **Learning & Improvement**
   Continuously learns from past outcomes and feedback.
